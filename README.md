Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. 

*italic* _italic_ **bold** __bold__

Hrm, this seems to be a lot like Reddit.

Inline style URL:
An [example](http://www.google.com "Title")

Reference style URL:
An [example][id]. Then, anywhere
else in the doc, define the link:

  [id]: http://example.com/  "Title"

![alt text](/path/img.jpg "Title")

![alt text][id]

[id]: /url/to/img.jpg "Title"

`<code>` spans are delimited
by backticks.

You can include literal backticks
like `` `this` ``.


This is a normal paragraph.

    This is a preformatted
    code block.
